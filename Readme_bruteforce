## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a brute-force attack simulation on a test website using open-source tools such as Hydra, Crunch, CeWL, and SecLists. It accompanies a research paper written as part of a cybersecurity academic program at Purdue Global University.

## 📄 Contents

* [`Brute_Force_Attack_Research_Paper.pdf`](./Brute_Force_Attack_Research_Paper.pdf) – The full academic paper
* [`screenshots/`](./screenshots/) – (Optional) Screenshots of tools, form reconnaissance, Hydra output
* [`wordlists/`](./wordlists/) – Sample wordlists (`users.txt`, `pass.txt`)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)
* [Hydra](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/hydra)
* [Crunch](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/crunch)
* [CeWL](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/cewl)
* `rockyou.txt`
* [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

## ⚙️ Methodology Highlights

* Reconnaissance of login forms
* Custom wordlist generation
* Hydra-based brute-force attack simulation
* Analysis of outcomes and defensive recommendations

## 🔐 Defensive Recommendations

* Multi-factor authentication
